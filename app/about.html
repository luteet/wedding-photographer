						I grew up in the North East, the daughter of artists, in a house filled with music and design, so creativity is in my blood. I’m now based in East London, shooting narrative lifestyle photography, capturing those everyday moments that tell a story and add warmth and authenticity to a shoot. I aim for relaxed, positive energy on shoot days, letting genuine interactions unfold, steering and directing people and moments to create stylish but believable imagery.
					</p>
					<p>
						I thrive on the challenges that come with large scale productions and tight deadlines, and the energy that comes from working with a big crew. I’m lucky to have a talented team around me, we aim to always have fun on set (after all we’re able to make pictures for a living!) and keep things fast paced and collaborative.
